This text file describes how the domain folder should be used.
Domain holds definitions for classes/objects
that represent data and object instances that the app uses.

for example, the ##card## class represents a card object,
and is used by the cardRepository or any relevant services.

adhering to the Java convention would require the 
file name to match the class name defined in the file,
with the class name following the uppercase camel-case convention,
but rules could bend since we are using javascript.
